# Game Economy Balance Strategy

## Resource Costs and Mining:

- **Dirt**: Basic resource, easily mined. Yield: 1-5 units per shovel level.
- **Wood**: Medium resource, requires more time to gather. Yield: 1-5 units per axe level.
- **Stone**: Rare resource, hardest to gather. Yield: 1-5 units per pickaxe level.

## Tool Upgrading:

- **Upgrade Cost**: Fixed price, e.g., 10 dirt, 15 wood, 20 stone to upgrade any tool from one level to the next.

## Seeds and Harvest:

- Set seed costs: For example, 5 dirt, 5 wood, 5 stone per seed packet.
- Growth time and harvest profit:
    - **Tomatoes**: 2 days growth, 10 coins per vegetable.
    - **Pumpkins**: 3 days growth, 15 coins per vegetable.
    - **Radishes**: 1 day growth, 5 coins per vegetable.
    - **Carrots**: 2 days growth, 12 coins per vegetable.
    - **Eggplants**: 3 days growth, 20 coins per vegetable.
    - **Corn**: 4 days growth, 25 coins per vegetable.

## Weekly Quotas:

- Set clear but achievable goals for each weekly quota. Quotas encourage players to plan and use resources efficiently.
- **Rewards**: Decide if players receive rewards for meeting quotas, such as extra resources, unique seeds, or farm upgrades.

## Mechanics Development:

- **UI**: Develop a clear and understandable UI showing current resources, tool levels, available seeds, and quota status.
- **Balance**: Start with provided figures but be ready to adjust them based on tester feedback.
- **Player Motivation**: Provide players with clear understanding of how tool upgrades and seed purchases can help meet quotas and improve their farm.

## Testing and Adjustment:

- **Playtesting**: Offer the game to a group of testers and collect their feedback.
- **Data Analysis**: Evaluate how long players meet quotas, how easily they upgrade tools, and how often they purchase seeds.
- **Balance Adjustments**: Make necessary changes to optimize gameplay and player engagement.

Ensure these elements for a robust and engaging farm game economy.
